# node-template

Heavily opiniated template for `Node.js` projects. It has only some basic things setup, so it's suitable for anything.

Main elements are:
- **pnpm** - efficient packet manager
- **nodemon** - restart your app when code changes
- **eslint** and **prettier** - for code formatting and keeping style uniform
- **husky** - pre-commit hooks with auto fixing and formating

**NOTE:** **pnpm** and **npm** can be used interchangeably.

## Development

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run prepare`

## Optional packages
- [Module Alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias) - easier imports
